			<h1>My Personal vision is to connect like-minded people.</h1>
			<p>We all have many different interests. Meeting people with similar interests and exchanging ideas about our interests is one of the greatest joys in life. However, actually finding these people is quite difficult. We would often post on our blogs or social networks, but only to find out not enough people in our personal networks share the same interests that we do. I might write a long article about how to create a faux gradient background for websites, but many people in my social network are not that interested in web design. On the other hand, there's a ton of people who crave to learn web design, but cannot find these articles that experienced designers would want to write about. There's this disjoint between writers and readers - people with similar interests in general. That's why I want to create Ego, a community for people's interests.</p>
			<h1>Iris is a place where collective minds come together.</h1>
			<p>The goal of Iris is to connect like-minded people by helping writers reach the audience and helping readers find content that cater to their interests. We do this by taking an article that users publish on Ego, identify its topic using our keyword extraction algorithm, and share it with users who are subscribed to the topic. Imagine what this would do for people. You can write a rant about Bitcoins, and share it with people who are interested in investing in Bitcoins. Or, you can talk about the upcoming Coldplay concert and see if anyone interested in Coldplay would like to go with you. You can even use this to market your business by asking questions to a specific interest group.</p>
